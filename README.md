just enter the string you want to count and that's it!
this simple program will remove spaces so you just count the string that has a characters in it,
for example "  hello" would count as 5 instead of 7(I put double spaces before typing),
so you don't have to worry for counting blank,

I also put some info for hashes and their digits just to make it easier to determine when you counting hashes.
